# Lazy Fortran 2025 Design (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Welcome to the **Lazy Fortran 2025** design notes. This is a **WORK IN
PROGRESS** view of where the language is headed.

- [LF‑0001: Lazy Fortran 2025 Feature Overview](lazyfortran2025-design.md)  
  Short, user‑facing summary of core features (syntax, tooling, packages).
- [Unified Grammar Architecture](UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md)  
  Background on the grammar inheritance model used in this repository.
- [Fixed-form Fortran Support](fixed_form_support.md)  
  Explicit description of the fixed-form subset implemented for
  historical dialects and Fortran 90/95/2003+, and the remaining gaps
  tracked by Issue #91.

For detailed discussion, see issues #51–#57 and related design issues on
