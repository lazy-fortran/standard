- **Enhanced allocatable**: allocatable components, SOURCE allocation
- **Abstract interfaces**: ABSTRACT INTERFACE blocks
- **Procedure pointers**: procedure components and pointers
- **SELECT TYPE**: construct for polymorphism
- **IEEE arithmetic**: support for IEEE floating-point
- **Enhanced I/O**: STREAM access, user-defined derived type I/O

## ‚úÖ Fortran 2008 (2008) - Parallel Programming Revolution
**STATUS: Historically Accurate**
- **Coarrays**: `REAL :: x[*]` for parallel programming (revolutionary!)
- **Submodules**: for large module organization
- **DO CONCURRENT**: parallelizable loops
- **BLOCK construct**: local scoping
- **Critical sections**: CRITICAL construct
- **Synchronization**: SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, SYNC MEMORY
- **LOCK/UNLOCK**: statements for thread safety
- **Enhanced allocation**: MOLD keyword, coarray allocation
- **NEWUNIT**: automatic unit number generation for I/O

## ‚úÖ Fortran 2018 (2018) - Teams and Error Handling  
**STATUS: Historically Accurate**
- **Teams**: FORM TEAM, CHANGE TEAM, END TEAM (hierarchical parallelism!)
- **Events**: EVENT_TYPE, EVENT POST, EVENT WAIT
- **Collective subroutines**: CO_BROADCAST, CO_SUM, CO_MAX, CO_MIN, CO_REDUCE
- **Enhanced error handling**: improved ERROR STOP, FAIL IMAGE
- **Atomic operations**: ATOMIC_ADD, ATOMIC_FETCH_*, etc.
- **Image failure recovery**: FAILED_IMAGES, IMAGE_STATUS, STOPPED_IMAGES
- **Enhanced C interoperability**: assumed-type (`TYPE(*)`), assumed-rank (`DIMENSION(..)`)

## ‚úÖ Fortran 2023 (2023) - Minor Revision with Corrections
**STATUS: Historically Accurate (CORRECTED)**

‚ùå **REMOVED INCORRECT FEATURES:**
- ~~Generic programming with parameterized modules~~ (NOT in F2023!)
- ~~Conditional expressions (`?:` operator)~~ (NOT in F2023!)  
- ~~Half precision (REAL16)~~ (NOT specifically added in F2023!)
- ~~Major syntax changes~~ (NOT in F2023!)

‚úÖ **ACTUAL F2023 FEATURES:**
- **Enumerated types**: `ENUM` construct with `ENUMERATOR` (actual new feature!)
- **Corrections and clarifications** to F2018 standard
- **Minor interoperability improvements**  
- **Error handling enhancements**
- **Standard library clarifications**

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: F2023 is explicitly described as a "minor revision" focused on corrections and small additions, not revolutionary new features.

## üîß Architecture Corrections Made

1. **Removed fictional features** from F2023 (generics, conditional expressions)
2. **Added actual enumerated types** to F2023 implementation
3. **Verified all major features** against official ISO standards and documentation
4. **Maintained inheritance chain** accuracy across all standards
5. **Updated test cases** to reflect actual language features

## üìö Historical Accuracy Sources

- Official ISO/IEC standards documents
- Fortran Wiki (fortranwiki.org)  
- J3 Fortran standards committee documents
- "The New Features of Fortran 2023" by John Reid
- Intel Fortran Compiler documentation
- GNU Fortran standards compliance documentation

The tree-sitter grammars now accurately reflect the true historical evolution of Fortran from 1957 to 2023, without fictional features or anachronistic additions.
