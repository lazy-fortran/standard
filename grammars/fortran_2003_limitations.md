# Fortran 2003 Implementation - Known Limitations

## Current Status
- **Test Coverage**: 11/32 tests passing (34% pass rate)
- **Architecture**: ✅ Complete and working
- **Basic Parsing**: ✅ Programs and modules parse correctly
- **Token Recognition**: ✅ All F2003 tokens recognized

## Known Issues

### 1. Procedure Pointer Parsing
- **Issue**: NEWLINE handling in procedure pointer declarations
- **Example**: `procedure(interface), pointer :: proc_ptr`
- **Status**: Parser recognizes syntax but fails on line breaks
- **Impact**: 1 test failing

### 2. Complex OOP Constructs  
- **Issue**: Full OOP parsing not complete
- **Examples**: Complex inheritance hierarchies, abstract interfaces
- **Status**: Tokens defined, basic structure works, complex cases fail
- **Impact**: Multiple comprehensive tests failing

### 3. C Interoperability
- **Issue**: ISO_C_BINDING constructs not fully parsed
- **Status**: BIND(C) token works, complex interop fails
- **Impact**: C interop test failing

### 4. ASSOCIATE/BLOCK Constructs
- **Issue**: Scope handling in nested constructs
- **Status**: Basic structure defined, execution fails
- **Impact**: 2 tests failing

## Working Features

✅ **Fully Functional:**
- Program and module declarations
- Basic type declarations
- Simple CLASS declarations
- VOLATILE/PROTECTED attributes
- Import statements
- Basic derived types

✅ **Tokens Recognized (Parser WIP):**
- All OOP tokens (ABSTRACT, EXTENDS, FINAL, etc.)
- Procedure pointer tokens
- C interop tokens (BIND, VALUE)
- Enhanced I/O tokens (ASYNCHRONOUS, STREAM, etc.)

## Architecture Success

The unified grammar architecture is **complete and proven**:
- Clean inheritance chain: F77 → F90 → F95 → F2003
- Both fixed-form and free-form support
- No duplication of rules
- Proper separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Fix NEWLINE handling in lexer/parser
2. Complete OOP parsing rules
3. Implement full C interoperability
4. Add comprehensive test coverage
5. Achieve >50% test pass rate

## Usage

Despite limitations, the F2003 grammar can parse:
- Basic F2003 programs
- Simple OOP constructs
- Most F95/F90/F77 legacy code
- Module structures

For production use, recommend focusing on basic F2003 features until full implementation is complete.
