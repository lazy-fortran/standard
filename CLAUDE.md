# Claude Development Guidelines for LazyFortran2025 Standard

## Project Context
You are working on the LazyFortran2025 standard grammar implementation, a comprehensive ANTLR4-based parser for all FORTRAN/Fortran standards from 1957 to LazyFortran2025.

## Architecture Overview

### Modular Grammar Hierarchy
```
SharedCore â†’ FORTRAN â†’ FORTRAN_II â†’ FORTRAN_IV â†’ FORTRAN66 â†’ FORTRAN77 â†’ Fortran90 â†’ ... â†’ LazyFortran2025
```

Each grammar:
- Only defines NEW features (no duplication)
- Imports from its predecessor
- Maintains historical accuracy

### Directory Structure
- `grammars/` - Source .g4 files (commit these)
- `build/` - Generated files (never commit)
- `tests/` - Test suites (comprehensive validation)
- `scripts/` - Build automation

## Development Principles

### Strict Requirements
1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR
2. **No shortcuts**: Full implementation, no stubs
3. **Clean code**: Self-documenting, no unnecessary comments
4. **Small commits**: Incremental, well-documented changes
5. **Historical accuracy**: Respect each standard's era

### Grammar Rules
- SharedCore contains ONLY universal constructs (1957-2025+)
- Each standard grammar imports and extends its predecessor
- Use ANTLR4 import mechanism for inheritance
- Maintain correct operator precedence

### Naming Conventions
- Classic standards: All caps (FORTRAN, FORTRAN_II, FORTRAN77)
- Modern standards: Mixed case (Fortran90, Fortran2003)
- Latest extension: LazyFortran2025

## Build Process

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile that handles all grammar builds with proper dependency management:

```bash
# Build all grammars in dependency order
make all

# Build specific standard (automatically builds dependencies)
make Fortran2003

# Clean all generated files
make clean

# Run tests after building
make test

# Show available targets and timeline
make help

# Force rebuild everything
make force-rebuild
```

Available targets:
- `FORTRAN` - Build FORTRAN I (1957)
- `FORTRANII` - Build FORTRAN II (1958)
- `FORTRANIV` - Build FORTRAN IV (1962)
- `FORTRAN66` - Build FORTRAN 66 (1966)
- `FORTRAN77` - Build FORTRAN 77 (1977)
- `Fortran90` - Build Fortran 90 (1990)
- `Fortran95` - Build Fortran 95 (1995)
- `Fortran2003` - Build Fortran 2003 (2003)

### Manual Build (Alternative)

```bash
# Build grammars in dependency order
./scripts/build_grammar.sh shared_core
./scripts/build_grammar.sh FORTRAN
./scripts/build_grammar.sh FORTRAN_II  # When implemented
```

### Build Output

All generated files are placed in the `build/` directory (git-ignored):
```
build/
â”œâ”€â”€ FORTRAN/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FORTRANLexer.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FORTRANParser.py
â”œâ”€â”€ Fortran2003/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Fortran2003Lexer.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Fortran2003Parser.py
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Testing Strategy

### Required Test Coverage
- Operator precedence validation
- Parse tree semantic analysis
- Historical code examples
- Edge cases and error conditions

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific suite
python tests/shared_core/test_comprehensive_validation.py
```

## Current Status

### Completed
- âœ… SharedCore grammar (universal constructs)
- âœ… FORTRAN (1957) grammar
- âœ… Modular inheritance architecture
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite
- âœ… Build automation

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ FORTRAN_II implementation
- ðŸ”„ Additional historical standards

### Future Work
- Fortran90 free-form revolution
- Modern Fortran features (2003-2023)
- LazyFortran2025 type inference

## Resources
- Fortran standards: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranStandards
- ANTLR4 documentation: https://www.antlr.org/
- Historical FORTRAN manuals: IBM archives

## Important Notes

### DO NOT
- Commit generated files (build/ directory)
- Duplicate rules between grammars
- Take shortcuts or create stubs
- Mix concerns between standards

### ALWAYS
- Follow TDD methodology
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document historical context
- Test comprehensively

## GitHub Integration

### Issues
Update issues with progress, maintain accurate status:
- Issue #6: SharedCore (Complete)
- Issue #10: FORTRAN 1957 (Complete)
- Issue #2: LazyFortran2025 (Future)

### Pull Requests
- Small, focused changes
- Comprehensive commit messages
- Address review feedback promptly
- Include test coverage

## LazyFortran2025 Vision

The ultimate goal is LazyFortran2025:
- Full type inference
- Modern syntax extensions
- Backward compatible with all FORTRAN/Fortran
- Performance optimizations
- Seamless C/Python interop

Remember: We're building the future of Fortran by understanding and respecting its past.
